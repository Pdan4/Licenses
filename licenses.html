<p>TF2Maps.net offers a custom set of License Agreements to creators. These are specifically tailored for use with maps and map assets. When uploading a map or asset to this site, you can choose the fitting license variant from the drop-down.</p>
<p>DROPDOWN SCREENSHOT HERE</p>
<p>(INFOBOX!) These licenses are non-exclusive. This means you, the author of a work, may relicense your work or withdraw it from the site whenever you want or dedicate different license terms for different people. The control over your work ALWAYS stays with you. TF2Maps does not claim any ownership whatsoever over your work, or will ever tell you what you can or cannot do with it</p>
<p>Please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us via Forum DMs or Discord if you have any questions.</p>
<p>We currently offer the following licenses:</p>
<h3 id="compiled-map-license">Compiled Map License</h3>
<p>TF2MCL: Compiled Map - Default
TF2MCL: Compiled Map - No SDK Use</p>
<h3 id="asset--vmf-license">Asset / VMF License</h3>
<p>TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - Default
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No Derivations
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No Workshop Uploading
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No SDK Use
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No Derivations + No Workshop Uploading
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No Derivations + No SDK Use
TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - No Derivations + No SDK Use + No Workshop Uploading</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may dedicate your work to the <strong>Public Domain</strong>, giving up all rights on the work and allowing others to use it without any restrictions. You can also select <strong>Custom License</strong> if you want to supply your own with the download or in the download description.</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Which license should I pick?</strong>
The vast majority of users will be fine with the DEFAULT licenses or by dedicating their work to the Public Domain. You should only look into the other license variations if you have specific reasons to do so. You are also free to include your own license with your work, like Creative Commons, if you wish.
If you need help making a decision, here is a Flowchart (LINK!!!).</p>
<p><strong>How do I add these licenses to my maps or assets?</strong>
On a newly created download, there will be a drop-down menu in which you can select the license of your choice. If you do not have any special concerns, the default license (“TF2MCL: Compiled Map - Default” or ”TF2MCL: Asset / VMF - Default”) should suffice.
On an existing download, click on the three dots in the top right and then “Edit Download”, then select your license in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>How do I credit someone?</strong>
For TF2Maps Downloads, we generally consider it good enough if you include a list of used works and authors in the Download’s description. We generally do not enforce crediting in early alpha maps in which used assets may change with every version. A general note like “This map uses Frontline Assets” is perfectly enough. Just be sure to update the description as work goes on.
On the Steam Workshop, you must add the asset’s author to your friend list and then add them as a contributor to the Workshop item.
For more information, see <a href="https://tf2maps.net/threads/guide-how-to-use-custom-assets-without-getting-sued.48611/">Brokk’s guide</a> on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Can I take back a license or change it at a later time?</strong>
Yes, but we would like to ask you to only do so if absolutely necessary. You can always loosen restrictions on usage of your work, but adding additional restrictions after your work has already been published (for example, adding the NO DERIVATIONS clause to an asset that was previously uploaded without this restriction) will confuse users and erode trust.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I break these licenses?</strong>
That depends on what you did exactly. Taking another user’s work for your own is a ban-worthy offense, but we only enforce it strictly with finished maps or things uploaded to non-TF2M places like the Steam Workshop, Gamebanana, etc. Depending on the platform, we will also encourage the real author to issue a takedown request to have the work removed in case of infringement. In the case of the Steam Workshop, this may also have other consequences. Generally, we try to assume it was an honest mistake unless you double down on it.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there no “Yes Derivations” license option for compiled maps?</strong>
Because a compiled map is a finished product. Changing it would require decompiling it, which can lead to issues. If you want to allow others to edit your compiled map, we encourage you to share the VMF directly instead, using our ASSET / VMF License.</p>
