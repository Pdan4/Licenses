<p>A .BSP file that contains level data for Team Fortress 2 or another Source Engine game. May contain assets packed into it as well.</p>
<p><strong>Asset</strong></p>
<p>Any kind of creative work that may end up compiled into a .BSP file. This includes, but is not limited to: Models, textures, materials, sounds, particles, scripts, prefabs, and many other file types. For the purposes of this license agreement, an uncompiled Hammer Editor file (such as .vmf, .vmx, .vmap) will also be considered an asset.</p>
<p><strong>Author, Original Creator</strong></p>
<p>The individual or individuals who originally created the work. Alternatively, the individual or individuals permitted to upload the work on TF2Maps.net. Authors of a work have all the rights to its derivations but must still properly credit the authors of the derivations, unless there is a written agreement otherwise (with each derivation&#39;s creator). Authors of derived works who want additional rights beyond crediting should discuss this with the original creators.</p>
<p><strong>Steam Workshop, Valve</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/440/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a>, owned by Valve Corporation, which also owns Team Fortress 2. Uploading an item to the Steam Workshop requires signing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement">Steam Subscriber Agreement</a> as well as the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoplegalagreement/?appid=440">Supplemental Workshop Terms - Revenue Sharing</a>. This document is about money, and you want to actually read it before signing.</p>
